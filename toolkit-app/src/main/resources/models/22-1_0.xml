If the ReportLinks Resource is present, the notification sent to the LwM2M Server will only include the Resources that are listed in ReportLinks and not include the value of the Resource ObserveLinks.

		<Description2><![CDATA[Notes:
(1)	When the ResourceFilter is set to TRUE, this condition takes precedence over any pmax. Namely, when the LwM2M Server set the Resource ResourceFilter to TRUE, whatever the pmax attribute is attached to any resource included in the ObserveLinks, the Report is only populated by the LwM2M Client each time the resources included in the ObserveLinks are changed.
(2)	Any default pmax and pmin values which have been configured in the Server Object should not apply to VirtualObserveNotify and each instance of this object should use explicit pmin and pmax as requested by the LwM2M Server when setting up notifications.]]></Description2>
