# A handy client toolkit CLI for IoT developers and learners

`Toolkit` is a client command line tool that supports multiple IoT protocols. **CoAP** and  **MQTT** protocols are currently supported. more protocols will be supported in the future. it is written in the java language, but does not rely on the JRE environment.

## Future

- multi-platform support: mac„ÄÅlinux and windows;

- very small and takes up little memory;

- command's output look good in both on windows and linux

- written in the java language, but does not rely on the JRE environment

- integration of multiple protocols eliminates the neet to open multiple client software

## CoAP

```bash
mushuwei@mushuweideMacBook-Pro-2 ~ % toolkit coap -h

MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)

MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things (IoT).
It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport
that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a small code footprint and
minimal network bandwidth. MQTT today is used in a wide variety of industries,
such as automotive, manufacturing, telecommunications, oil and gas, etc.
